I'm a full-stack developer that studies computer science student who works at the same time.

I'm also a self-taught Linux enthusiast. I like low-level programming, but I currently use Typescript professionally. I also try to be up-to-date with new tech, such as Rust and many OSS projects.
Other tools I use: neovim, VSCode, Jetbrians IDEs, git and many Linux system utilities.

I like to tinker a lot, so I use ArchLinux. I also help to translate open-source projects to my language, Catalan, such as the Gnome apps and some other GTK ones that I usually use myself.
