I am a young engineering student with the ambition to work on professional projects to develop my own skills and learn new ones.

I work in a startup, IZI Record, in the development team.

I'm a self-taught Linux enthusiast. Currently trying to learn Rust.
I've been taught C, C#, Java and SQL.
Other tools I use: vim, VSCode, git and many Linux system utilities.

I like to tinker a lot, so I use Arch. I also help translating open-source projects mainly to Catalan, such as the Gnome apps and some other GTK ones that I usually use myself.
